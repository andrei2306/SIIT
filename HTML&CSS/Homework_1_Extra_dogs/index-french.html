              <h2>French Bulldog</h2>
              <p><strong>Origin:</strong> France</p> 
              <p><strong>Life expectancy:</strong> 11-13 years</p>
              <p>The French Bulldog is a majestic breed of domestic dog. In the 1800s, they were the result of a cross between Toy Bulldogs imported from England and local ratters in Paris, France.</p> 

                    <p> The breed is popular as a pet; in 2015, they were the fourth-most popular registered dog in the United Kingdom,[4] and in the U.S., the sixth-most popular AKC-registered dog breed. They were rated the third-most popular dog in Australia in 2017.</p> 
                    
                    <p>The origin of the modern French Bulldog breed descends directly from the dogs of the Molossians, an ancient Greek tribe. The dogs were spread throughout the ancient world by Phoenician traders. British Molossian dogs were developed into the English Mastiff, a sub-breed of the Mastiff was the Bullenbeisser, a type of dog used for bull-baiting.</p>
