          <p>Marc Van Peteghem with Vincent Lauriot-Prévost of the naval architecture design office, internationally renowned for its multihulls, VPLP are the designers. Lagoon gives priority to life on board. They endeavour to maintain this feeling of coherence and harmony, when sailing on board a Lagoon. Additionally, as the DNA inclines us to draw seaworthy, safe boats, we strive to reach high, even very high performance levels. Their knowledge of multihulls is phenomenal and their experience unique.</p>
        <h1>LAGOON CUSTOM</h1>

          <p>Since 1999, Lagoon built their large models catamarans (from 50 ‘) at the CNB Shipyard. It has been a natural inertia to continue with the development of the Lagoon “custom” models with this internationally recognized shipyard.</p>

          <p>An offer for sailors who dream to build a unique catamaran, even more luxurious and specially designed according to their specifications. The CNB Shipyard is one of the few shipyards that offers the construction of a large custom catamaran thanks to their experience in aluminum and composites.</p>

          <p>Renowned names of naval architecture, Marc Van Peteghem and Vincent Lauriot Prévost, Philippe Brand, Bill Dixon and Berret-Racoupeau Yacht Design (all winners of numerous international awards), have joined forces with Lagoon and CNB to design these super-catamarans motor and sailing.</p>
